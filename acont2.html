                    I love Instagram, most of the youngsters nowadays play Instagram. It's become a part of my life so to speak and it's fun to share what I like. There are so many different social medias nowadays, and social media platforms have changed the way people connect, communicate, and view the world in the digital age (Senft & Jurgenson, 2016).Instagram is one of these very popular platforms that has revolutionized the way people view their online identity and visual communication. However, with its rise has come a host of ethical issues and conflicts, from privacy concerns to its impact on mental health and social standards. The purpose of this paper is to critically analyze Instagram through a critical historical analysis of its birth, development, usage trends, and legal disputes.

                    In October 2010, Instagram which was founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger—was made available only for iOS devices as a photo-sharing app (O'Brien, 2018). The app, which was formerly known as Burbn, underwent extensive development before becoming Instagram. Instagram's primary goal upon introduction was to facilitate communication between users via images and stories. It transformed mobile photography with the advent of the filter tool, drawing millions of users in just its first year of release. Its simplicity and distinctive way of highlighting visual content drew users in right away, hastening adoption and development. An increasing number of investors and IT enthusiasts are showing a great interest in Instagram due to its user-friendly interface and well-chosen design. In this article I will discuss the historical trajectory of Instagram, as well as the evolution of its usage and the controversies and negative impacts that have arisen.

                    Facebook noticed Instagram's explosive growth and acquired the platform in April 2012 for approximately $1 billion (O'Brien, 2018). With this acquisition, Instagram was able to   
operate autonomously while gaining access to Facebook's vast user base and resources. As a result of this well thought out decision, Instagram was able to develop its functionality and user experience while maintaining its uniqueness. With the addition of new features such as Stories, IGTV, and Reels, Instagram has evolved to increase user engagement and adapt to various user preferences (O'Brien, 2018). With these improvements, Instagram becomes a versatile platform for content generation, consumption and community building. And the users coming from all over the world and the ever-changing social dynamics of the network, these advancements have helped Instagram maintain its position as a leader in the social media industry.

                    However, Instagram has not been immune to controversy and ethical dilemmas in its rise to prominence. Its impact on mental health, particularly on younger users, is one of the most pressing issues (Tandoc et al., 2015). Studies have shown that excessive Instagram use is associated with poor mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression and body image issues. This is because users compare themselves to the idealized image promoted on Instagram. It has been said that the Instagram platform's emphasis on grooming for perfection and recognition through likes and followers can leave users feeling inadequate and with a reduced sense of self-worth.

                  <div class="p-lower-kv__outline p-lower-kv__outline--col2 sj">
                    In addition, Instagram has been criticized for the way it handles user privacy and data (O'Brien, 2018). The platform has attracted criticism for its targeting algorithms, methods of data collection, and vulnerability to manipulation by bad actors. Incidents of data breaches and privacy abuses have undermined user confidence, which has led to calls for Instagram to be more open and accountable. Instagram wants to promote user autonomy and engagement, but occasionally granting access on specific topics can be counterproductive and, more importantly
exacerbate social media problems. The way people use Instagram has evolved along with the platform itself.

                  <div class="p-lower-kv__outline p-lower-kv__outline--col2 sj">

                    Beyond the behavior of individual users, Instagram's influence on cultural perceptions and social standards is pervasive. Perceptions of beauty, identity, and self-expression have changed due to the platform's emphasis on aesthetics and visual narratives. But I think most social media outlets actually have this effect, such as TikTok and so on. And, Instagram has also been criticized for its role in spreading unrealistic beauty standards and diet recipes, strange claims about the body, and other harmful aspects. Instagram’s emphasis on the number of likes, comments, and followers creates a culture that seeks the approval of others and social comparisons, which leads to negative psychological outcomes for many users, especially younger users .Influencers and brands promote products, lifestyles, and ideologies through Instagram's reach and influence, blurring the line between authenticity and commercialization. Instagram has also come under fire for encouraging unreasonable standards of happiness and success and for exacerbating social divisions. The platform's automated content selection feature often acts as a filter, limiting exposure to a variety of viewpoints and exacerbating divisions.

                  <div class="p-lower-kv__outline p-lower-kv__outline--col2 sj">
                    Instagram's usage patterns over time show how society has evolved in terms of fostering community, expressing oneself, and communicating in general. What was once a simple platform for exchanging photos and day-to-day happenings has grown into a complex, multifaceted social media network where influencers, companies, and a diverse array of individuals compete for users' attention. Instagram's growing user base and influence have made it the go-to platform for visibility, recognition, and influence. The quantity of likes, 
comments, and following on the platform has led to the emergence of a competitive mentality. Some people have even gone so far as to determine whether a celebrity is eligible for an event based on the number of followers they have. I think this can lead to the average user feeling pressured to flaunt their life, and I've seen how the average user is taught how to decorate their interface and how to run it just to create an idealized look, but obviously that's not what we really have.

                  <div class="p-lower-kv__outline p-lower-kv__outline--col2 sj">
                    So for these situations, I came up with some suggestions to improve. First of all, I think Instagram should provide stronger privacy settings as well as protection to prioritize users' privacy, such as who can view this content, with fine-grained control down to each individual. Then it should recognize misinformation and inaccuracies to prevent them from spreading widely on the platform. This part also requires the use of big data or artificial intelligence. Also, regarding mental health issues, it's hard to do this through a platform, but I think it's possible to monitor whether there's any anxiety-inducing information being spread, and to promote more positive and diverse images posted by users, and so on. Finally, I think it's important to promote authenticity among users, as some of the followers on the platform are fake accounts. There is in fact no such person, but an account will be created to follow someone else to make it look like they have a lot of fans and followers. I think this kind of behavior should be reduced. It will affect the judgment of many people, for example if a brand appears on the platform which sells some clothing. It has a lot of followers, but a large part of these followers are false, when the user sees, many people will think that it must be the brand's products are good and then purchase. However, this is not the case, which will harm the user's own interests. This behavior should be stopped.

                    In conclusion, Instagram's growth from an obscure photo-sharing software to a global cultural sensation has been marked by both successes and ethical dilemmas. While technology has transformed visual communication and connection, unchecked expansion and influence has also raised serious concerns about mental health, privacy, and social impact. As we traverse the complexities of the digital age, it is critical to consider how social media sites such as Instagram affect our online relationships and cultural norms. It is only through ethical oversight, educated discussion, and collective effort that we will be able to realize the full potential of social media to benefit society while mitigating its negative impact on people and communities.（1304 words）
