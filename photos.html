                <p class="figcaption">When I first started preparing my portfolio, I didn't know what subject to prepare. Finally, the reason for selecting intangible cultural heritage is that nowadays, the process of science and technology is very fast, everyone is in a fast pace, and many intangible cultural heritage are gradually forgotten or even cannot be inherited. So I hope that I can make more people notice them in a visual way. </p>

                    "Feitian" is an image of a deity or celestial being in traditional Chinese culture, originating from Taoist and Buddhist traditions. Feitian is often depicted as a light, graceful figure with flowing robes, exuding a sense of mystery. The image of Feitian is widely present in Chinese art, particularly in Buddhist art and mural paintings. Feitian symbolizes the descent of deities and conveys divine power.</p>

                <p  class="figcaption" >I chose Dunhuang colored sculptures to make the posters, which have a history of thousands of years, and many of the brushstrokes and techniques in Dunhuang murals cannot be reproduced today. However, due to the lack of attention in the past, many murals have been damaged and can not be seen in their original form. On the poster, I used some pictures of Dunhuang colored sculptures as the background.</p>

                <p  class="figcaption figcaptions">The other two posters, about LGBTQ as a whole, were made when I was a freshman. There was an advertising course where we were asked to come up with a product and sell it to a certain group, and I thought of watches. Because the strap can be changed at will, I thought of the most symbolic rainbow for the LGBTQ community.</p>
