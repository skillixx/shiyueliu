                    The second research is about cross-cultural communication. I think music is an obvious aspect of cross-cultural communication nowadays. And because I like Kpop very much, I have done some research about Kpop culture and how the fan groups will spread on social media, as well as the different influences they bring.

                          The 1990s saw the fusion of Western pop influences with Korean music by groups like Seo Taiji and Boys, giving rise to the global phenomenon known as K-Pop. The emergence of entertainment firms like SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, and YG Entertainment propelled the growth of K-Pop. By implementing a strict training program, these organizations produced polished idols with synchronized dance moves, eye-catching graphics, and appealing music. The early 2000s saw the start of K-Pop's serious globalization, but it wasn't until the 2010s that the genre really took off around the globe. While acts like Girls' Generation and Big Bang created waves, it was BTS (Bangtan Sonyeondan) that really took K-Pop worldwide with their distinct style and fan-connecting method.

                          BTS debuted under Big Hit Entertainment in 2013, when the label was smaller, but the unique concept centered on artistic freedom and authenticity. Unlike many Korean pop groups that adhere to a strict regimen, the members of BTS contribute to the songwriting process and actively engage with their fans. This approach, coupled with their willingness to address social issues such as mental health and teenage stress, has helped them stand out in a crowded industry. Many of their songs are great, and one is called DNA, which hit the Billboard Hot 100, a major milestone for the Korean pop group. BTS became the first K-Pop group to win a Billboard Music Award in 2017, and their influence has since spread to Western markets, culminating in record-breaking albums, sold-out concerts, and collaborations with international artists.

                      Their rise has been unprecedented. By utilizing social media, BTS has cultivated a global fan base called ARMY. ARMY has played a key role in BTS's success, using various platforms to promote the group, coordinate fan events and show their support for their favorite idols.

                    <div class="p-lower-kv__outline  p-lower-kv__outline--col2"><br></div>
                    <div class="p-lower-kv__outline sj p-lower-kv__outline--col2">In contrast to K-Pop, which is frequently accused for lacking diversity, BTS adopts a more accepting stance. A diverse range of performers and dancers from many nations, ethnicities, and backgrounds can be seen in their music videos and live performances. Furthermore, BTS has advocated for social problems using their platform, such as the "Love Yourself" campaign, which emphasizes mental health and self-acceptance. Additionally, they are working with UNICEF on the "End Violence" campaign, which highlights how crucial it is to make the world a safer place for young people. Regarding production, BTS is granted artistic freedom by Big Hit Entertainment to create music that embodies the viewpoints and experiences of its members. Fans of BTS who view the group as more than just a produced Korean pop group and who, in contrast to other Korean idols, their music has a soul and resonates with people.</div>
                    <div class="p-lower-kv__outline p-lower-kv__outline--col2"><br></div>
                    <div class="p-lower-kv__outline  sj p-lower-kv__outline--col2">In the music industry, ARMY is a distinct fan base known for its diversity and active participation. The ARMY has a diverse population that includes people of all ages, genders, and cultures. BTS had a sizable fan following in Korea and other East Asian nations at first, but its impact has swiftly spread outside, with sizable fan bases in the United States, Latin America, Europe, and Southeast Asia. ARMY's commitment is seen in their backing of BTS's song releases, live events, and charitable endeavors. Motivated by the ideals of BTS, the fan community frequently plans charitable functions, fan projects, and even educational events. And ARMY is active on social media, often coordinating campaigns to promote BTS's music and accomplishments. For example, in 2021, ARMY launched a trending hashtag on Twitter to support BTS's Grammy nomination, thereby increasing visibility and recognition. Twitter and Instagram are crucial sites for fan contact and content exchange, and they play a significant role in bringing the ARMY community together.</div>
                    <div class="p-lower-kv__outline p-lower-kv__outline--col2"><br></div>
                    <div class="p-lower-kv__outline  sj p-lower-kv__outline--col2">Fanfiction, fan films, and fan art are all excellent examples of ARMY's inventiveness and add to the thriving BTS community. Fanfiction and fan art examine various facets of BTS's music and members, such as how fans can improve one other's lives by utilizing the members' humorous emoticons or their music for editing and the websites such as Archive of Our Own (AO3) have large collections of the group's fanfiction. Fan art, including digital art and illustrations, is widely shared on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. Furthermore, BTS supporters are well-known for role-playing; they frequently dress up as their favorite members during concerts, there are even different themes for different concerts, and BTS will release the corresponding dress code to fans online in advance, and the group's close relationship with its followers has raised awareness and led to a number of fan-driven events. BTS's music has benefited greatly from ARMY's promotion on streaming services, which has helped them smash records on the charts. The fanbase has also mobilized to engage in social causes with charitable projects and fundraising events that mirror BTS's own philanthropic efforts. To celebrate BTS members' birthdays or other milestones, ARMY often organizes charity events. For example, in 2019, ARMY raised funds to build a school in Ghana to celebrate the sixth anniversary of BTS. In 2020, ARMY raised over $1 million for Black Lives Matter, matching a donation made by BTS. This demonstrated the fanbase's commitment to social justice and its capacity to mobilize for meaningful causes.</div>
                    <div class="p-lower-kv__outline  p-lower-kv__outline--col2"><br></div>
                    <div class="p-lower-kv__outline sj p-lower-kv__outline--col2">There are negative components among the ARMY fandom despite its excellent characteristics. Aggressive behavior by some BTS supporters towards other fan bases can result in online harassment and fan wars, including name-calling. Extremely fervent fans can go so far as to create false reports, send ominous packages, and make threatening remarks. In certain cases, ARMY has taken aggressive aim at reporters or reviewers who voice unfavorable views about BTS or the K-Pop scene. Sending hate mails, bombarding social media accounts, or even doxxing—disclosing private information—are examples of this type of harassment. For instance, a Washington Post reporter who questioned BTS's popularity and received harsh criticism for her piece received a lot of negative feedback online. There are even some fans who have a stress reaction to reviews, and there are some suggestions for BTS that might be positive and valid. But there are some fans who will feel that it is denigrating them and will fight back as well as defend accordingly. For example, after BTS was nominated for a 2020 Grammy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, some fans attacked other artists and their fans, arguing that BTS deserved to win the award, regardless of the ability and qualifications of other artists to win the award. These disputes have the potential to overshadow ARMY's beneficial contributions and increase tension and influence among Korean pop music enthusiasts as a whole. Social media is frequently used for malicious activity, and the instantaneous communication and anonymity it offers can make disputes worse. Fan conflicts between disparate Korean pop enthusiasts have the potential to worsen and result in abusive language, mansplaining, and other negative actions. A notable example is the rivalry between ARMY and fans of other K-Pop groups such as EXO and Blackpink. Fan wars often take place on Twitter, where people use hashtags and various other forms to discredit other groups and their fans. While ARMY's toxicity is only a small percentage, it will affect other people's opinions of this fanbase and their opinions of BTS, so I think these issues highlight the need for more understanding and respect between different fan groups, and that although they are different fan groups, there should be a source of joy and connection between all of them, not a source of animosity. It's important to note that a large number of ARMY members actively seek to counteract negativity and advance a supportive fan community. But as these instances show, there is a chance for negative activities to occur in online fan networks, thus it becomes critical to examine how fans can monitor one another.</div>

                    <div class="p-lower-kv__outline sj p-lower-kv__outline--col2">ARMY has been the main factor in BTS's popularity and has played a significant role in introducing K-Pop to a worldwide audience. The BTS community's inventiveness and diversity serve as an example of the good features of the fandom and show how music can bring individuals from all backgrounds and cultures together. Fan fights and poisonous content, on the other hand, highlight the intricacy of fan culture and serve as a reminder that fans should act with tolerance and respect. All things considered, BTS and ARMY are a formidable force in the music business, highlighting both the difficulties and the potential for fandom to effect good change. As BTS continues to grow, their influence on K-Pop and global pop culture will undoubtedly continue, with ARMY by their side to push the phenomenon forward. Since middle school, I've been a huge fan of Kpop, which has made me happy, but I've also seen a lot of negative things occur, such as people from different groups taking their own lives due to violence they saw online. Therefore, even though it's a different audience, these facts more than plenty to demonstrate that we should all take good care of the fan community.（1502 words）</div>
